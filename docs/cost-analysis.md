# AWS Cost Analysis and Budget

## Cost Breakdown

### AWS Free Tier Benefits (12 months)
Most AWS services include generous free tier allowances:

| **API Gateway** | 1M requests/month | <50K requests | $1.00/1M requests |
| **S3** | 5 GB storage | <1 GB | $0.023/GB |
| **CloudFormation** | 1,000 handler operations | <100 operations | $0.50/1K operations |
| **Cognito** | 50,000 MAUs | <10 users | $0.0055/MAU |

### Estimated Monthly Costs

#### Conservative Estimate (Light Usage)
- **DynamoDB**: $0 (within free tier)
- **Lambda**: $0 (within free tier)
- **API Gateway**: $0 (within free tier)
- **S3**: $0 (within free tier)
- **Other Services**: $0-2
- **Total**: $0-2/month

#### Realistic Estimate (Moderate Usage)
- **DynamoDB**: $0-3
- **Lambda**: $0-1
- **API Gateway**: $0-2
- **S3**: $0-1
- **CloudWatch**: $0-2
- **Other Services**: $0-3
- **Total**: $0-12/month

#### Maximum Estimate (Heavy Development)
- **DynamoDB**: $0-10
- **Lambda**: $0-5
- **API Gateway**: $0-5
- **S3**: $0-2
- **CloudWatch**: $0-5
- **Other Services**: $0-8
- **Total**: $0-35/month

## Cost Controls

### Automatic Safeguards
- **Free Tier Monitoring**: AWS alerts when approaching limits
- **Service Limits**: Built-in limits prevent runaway costs
- **Pay-per-use**: Only pay for what you actually use
- **No upfront costs**: No reserved instances or commitments

### Manual Controls
- **Billing Alerts**: Set up email notifications at $5, $10, $25
- **Budget Limits**: Create AWS budgets with automatic actions
- **Regular Monitoring**: Weekly cost reviews
- **Resource Tagging**: Track costs by project/feature

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### During Development
1. **Delete Unused Resources**: Clean up test data regularly
2. **Use Efficient Queries**: Optimize DynamoDB operations
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check AWS Cost Explorer weekly
4. **Pause When Not Working**: Stop sandbox when not developing

### Best Practices
- **Minimal Data**: Use small datasets for testing
- **Efficient Schemas**: Design DynamoDB tables efficiently
- **Batch Operations**: Group API calls to reduce costs
- **Clean Up**: Delete test resources after each session

## Budget Monitoring Setup

### Recommended Billing Alerts
```
Alert 1: $5 threshold (80% of expected monthly cost)
Alert 2: $15 threshold (120% of expected monthly cost)
Alert 3: $30 threshold (200% of expected monthly cost)
```

### AWS Budget Configuration
```yaml
Budget Name: "Amplify-POC-Budget"
Budget Amount: $25/month
Time Period: Monthly
Filters: 
  - Service: DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, S3
  - Tag: Project=AmplifyPOC
Actions:
  - Email notification at 80% of budget
  - Email notification at 100% of budget
```

## Cost Comparison

### Alternative Solutions
| Solution | Setup Cost | Monthly Cost | Complexity |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **AWS Amplify** | $0 | $0-25 | Low |
| **Firebase** | $0 | $0-30 | Low |
| **Heroku + PostgreSQL** | $0 | $7-50 | Medium |
| **Self-hosted VPS** | $0 | $10-20 | High |
| **Local Development** | $0 | $0 | High |

### ROI Justification
- **Learning Value**: Hands-on AWS experience
- **Skill Development**: Cloud-native application patterns
- **Future Projects**: Reusable knowledge and templates
- **Career Growth**: Valuable cloud development skills

## Emergency Procedures

### If Costs Exceed Budget
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Pause sandbox environment
   - Review AWS Cost Explorer
   - Identify high-cost resources
   - Delete unnecessary resources

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check CloudTrail for unusual activity
   - Review API usage patterns
   - Verify resource configurations
   - Contact AWS support if needed

3. **Prevention**:
   - Implement stricter alerts
   - Add resource-level budgets
   - Set up automated shutdowns
   - Review development practices

## Cleanup Cost Estimate

### Resource Deletion (End of POC)
- **Time Required**: 1-2 hours
- **Cost to Delete**: $0 (deletion is free)
- **Retained Costs**: $0 (all resources deleted)
- **Final Bill**: Final month's usage only

### Data Export (Optional)
- **S3 Export**: $0.10/GB
- **DynamoDB Export**: $0.10/GB
- **Expected Cost**: <$1 total

## Summary

The POC is designed to operate within AWS free tier limits, with realistic costs of $0-15/month. Multiple cost controls and monitoring systems ensure budget compliance while providing valuable learning opportunities.

**Recommendation**: Approve with $25/month budget limit and automated alerting.
