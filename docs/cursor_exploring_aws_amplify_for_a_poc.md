**User**

I'd like to work on an aws amplify project as a poc to explore various features

---

**Cursor**

That sounds like a great idea! AWS Amplify is a powerful tool for building full-stack applications quickly, especially with features like authentication, APIs, storage, and hosting.

To get started with your AWS Amplify proof of concept (POC), here’s a suggested plan:

### 1. Initialize the Project
- Decide if you want to use a frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, etc.) or just vanilla JS/HTML.
- Initialize your project (e.g., with create-react-app or similar).

### 2. Set Up Amplify
- Install the Amplify CLI.
- Configure the CLI with your AWS credentials.
- Initialize Amplify in your project.

### 3. Add Core Features
Pick features to explore, such as:
- **Authentication** (sign up, sign in, social login)
- **API** (GraphQL/REST, Lambda functions)
- **Storage** (S3 for files/images)
- **Hosting** (deploy your app)
- **Analytics, Predictions, etc.**

### 4. Push to AWS and Test
- Use the Amplify CLI to push resources to AWS.
- Integrate Amplify libraries in your frontend code.
- Test the features.

### 5. Iterate and Explore More Features

---

Would you like to:
- Start with a specific frontend framework (e.g., React)?
- Focus on a particular feature first (e.g., authentication)?
- Get step-by-step setup instructions?

Let me know your preferences, and I’ll guide you through the setup!

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

Great! To tailor the setup, could you clarify:

1. Which frontend framework would you like to use? (e.g., React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, or plain HTML/JS)
2. Is there a specific AWS Amplify feature you want to start with? (e.g., authentication, API, storage, hosting)
3. Do you already have AWS credentials set up on your machine, or do you need help with that?

Once you let me know, I’ll provide step-by-step instructions to get your AWS Amplify POC up and running!

---

**User**

react

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! We'll set up a React app and integrate AWS Amplify. Here’s the step-by-step plan:

### Step 1: Create a React App
We'll use Create React App for simplicity.

### Step 2: Install and Configure Amplify CLI
We'll install the Amplify CLI globally and configure it with your AWS credentials.

### Step 3: Initialize Amplify in Your Project
We'll set up Amplify in your React app.

### Step 4: Add Your First Feature (e.g., Authentication)
We'll add authentication as a starting feature (you can add more later).

---

**Let’s get started!**

#### 1. Create a React App

Would you like to create the React app inside your current `aws-amplify` directory, or in a new subdirectory (e.g., `aws-amplify/poc-app`)?  
Let me know your preference, and I’ll provide the exact commands!

---

**User**

I create it as a "to-do-list" app name, does it matter to be in root or in subfolder?

---

**Cursor**

Great question!  
**It does not technically matter** whether your React app is in the root or a subfolder, as long as you keep things organized and clear for yourself.

**Common practices:**
- If this repo will only contain the React app, putting it in the root is fine.
- If you plan to add more projects, scripts, or documentation later, a subfolder (e.g., `to-do-list/`) is cleaner.

**For most POCs and multi-project repos, a subfolder is recommended.**

**Summary:**  
- Root: Simpler, but less organized for future expansion.
- Subfolder: More organized, especially if you add backend code, docs, or other apps later.

Would you like to proceed with a subfolder named `to-do-list`? If yes, I’ll give you the commands to create the app there!

---

**User**

subfolder named to-do-list, use typescript

---

**Cursor**

Excellent choice! Here’s what we’ll do:

1. Create a React app in a subfolder named `to-do-list` using TypeScript.
2. Set up AWS Amplify after the app is created.

### Step 1: Create the React App

Run this command in your project root (`aws-amplify`):

```sh
npx create-react-app to-do-list --template typescript
```

Would you like me to propose this command for you to run, or will you run it yourself?

```shellscript
npx create-react-app to-do-list --template typescript
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

Your React + TypeScript app has been created in the `to-do-list` subfolder!

### Next Steps

1. **Set up AWS Amplify CLI** (if not already installed)
2. **Configure Amplify with your AWS credentials** (if not already done)
3. **Initialize Amplify in your React app**

Would you like to:
- Proceed with installing and configuring the Amplify CLI?
- Or have you already set up the Amplify CLI and AWS credentials on your machine?

Let me know, and I’ll guide you through the next step!

---

**User**

Proceed with installing and configuring the Amplify CLI

---

**Cursor**

The AWS Amplify CLI has been installed globally.

### Next Steps

1. **Configure the Amplify CLI with your AWS credentials**  
   This step will set up your AWS access for Amplify projects.

2. **Initialize Amplify in your React app**  
   This will create the necessary configuration files in your `to-do-list` project.

#### Step 1: Configure Amplify CLI

Run the following command and follow the prompts to sign in to your AWS account and set up a profile:

```sh
amplify configure
```

Would you like me to propose this command for you to run, or do you want to run it yourself?

```shellscript
amplify configure
```

---

**User**

yes

what to do?

---

**Cursor**

You’ve successfully configured the AWS Amplify CLI with your AWS credentials!

### Next Steps

1. **Initialize Amplify in your React app**
   - This will set up the Amplify backend environment and create the necessary configuration files in your `to-do-list` project.

#### Here’s what to do:

1. Change directory into your React app:
   ```sh
   cd to-do-list
   ```

2. Initialize Amplify:
   ```sh
   amplify init
   ```
   - When prompted, you can accept most defaults, but make sure to select the correct AWS profile (e.g., `aws-amplify-poc`).

Would you like me to run these commands for you, or would you like to do them yourself?

```shellscript
   cd to-do-list
```

```shellscript
   amplify init
```

**Cursor**

Amplify CLI is now prompting you to choose between the new "Amplify Gen 2" (code-first experience) and the classic "Amplify Gen 1" (CLI-driven).

- **Gen 2** is the latest, recommended approach, especially for new projects. It offers a more modern, code-centric workflow.
- **Gen 1** is the classic CLI-driven approach, still widely used and documented.

Would you like to proceed with:
- **Amplify Gen 2** (recommended for new projects)
- **Amplify Gen 1** (classic approach)

Let me know your preference, and I’ll guide you through the next steps!

---

**User**

Amplify Gen 2

---

**Cursor**

Great choice! Amplify Gen 2 offers a modern, code-first developer experience and is recommended for new projects.

### Next Steps for Amplify Gen 2

1. **Follow the Quickstart Guide**  
   The Gen 2 workflow is different from Gen 1. You’ll define your backend using code (in TypeScript) and manage it alongside your frontend.

2. **Install the Amplify Gen 2 Library**  
   In your React app directory, you’ll need to install the new Amplify libraries.

3. **Set Up Your Backend Directory**  
   You’ll create an `amplify/` directory in your project for backend configuration.

---

#### Let’s get started:

1. **Install the Amplify Gen 2 library:**
   ```sh
   npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
   ```

2. **Initialize the Amplify backend:**
   ```sh
   npx amplify sandbox
   ```
   This will set up the new code-first backend and guide you through the process.

Would you like me to run these commands for you?

```shellscript
   npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

```shellscript
   npx amplify sandbox
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

The Amplify CLI indicates that for Gen 2, you need to use the new backend CLI package: @aws-amplify/backend-cli.

### Next Steps

1. **Install the Amplify Backend CLI for Gen 2:**
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev @aws-amplify/backend-cli
   ```

2. **Initialize the Amplify Gen 2 backend:**
   ```sh
   npx @aws-amplify/backend-cli sandbox
   ```

Would you like me to run these commands for you?

```shellscript
   npm install --save-dev @aws-amplify/backend-cli
```

```shellscript
   npx @aws-amplify/backend-cli sandbox
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

The Amplify Gen 2 CLI has been renamed to ampx.

### Next Step

Run the following command to start the Amplify Gen 2 backend setup:

```sh
npx ampx sandbox
```

Would you like me to run this command for you?

```shellscript
npx ampx sandbox
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

The Amplify Gen 2 CLI (`ampx`) is indicating that it cannot find a default AWS region and suggests configuring a new Amplify profile using:

```sh
npx ampx configure profile
```

This will guide you through setting up your AWS credentials and region for Amplify Gen 2.

Would you like me to run this command for you?

```shellscript
npx ampx configure profile
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

Your AWS profile for Amplify Gen 2 is now configured (profile 'default' exists).

### Next Step

You can now start the Amplify Gen 2 backend sandbox:

```sh
npx ampx sandbox
```

Would you like me to run this command for you?

```shellscript
npx ampx sandbox
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

The error indicates that the default AWS region is still missing for your Amplify Gen 2 profile, even though the profile exists.

### How to Fix

You need to ensure your AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`) and config file (`~/.aws/config`) have a default region set for the profile you are using (likely `default`).

#### Here’s what to do:

1. **Check your AWS config file:**  
   Open `~/.aws/config` and make sure it contains something like:
   ```
   [default]
   region = us-east-1
   ```

2. **If the region is missing, add it manually.**  
   You can use any AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, etc.).

Would you like instructions on how to edit this file, or would you like me to propose a command to set the region for you?

```plaintext
   [default]
   region = us-east-1
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

The default AWS region has been set to us-east-1 for your profile.

You can now try starting the Amplify Gen 2 backend sandbox again:

```sh
npx ampx sandbox
```

Would you like me to run this command for you?

```shellscript
npx ampx sandbox
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

The error indicates that the `./amplify` directory does not exist in your project. For Amplify Gen 2, you need to define your backend using code in this directory.

### Next Steps

1. **Create the `amplify` directory in your project root.**
2. **Add a `backend.ts` file inside the `amplify` directory** to define your backend resources.

Would you like me to:
- Create the `amplify` directory and a starter `backend.ts` file for you?
- Or would you like instructions on what to put in the `backend.ts` file?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

```typescript
import { defineBackend } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

export const backend = defineBackend({
  // Add resources here (e.g., auth, api, storage)
});

```

The required package (`@aws-amplify/backend`) has been installed, resolving the import error in your `backend.ts` file.

### Next Step

You can now start the Amplify Gen 2 backend sandbox:

```sh
npx ampx sandbox
```

Would you like me to run this command for you?

```shellscript
npx ampx sandbox
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

The error message indicates that your AWS credentials have expired:

> ExpiredTokenException: The security token included in the request is expired

### How to Fix

You need to refresh or update your AWS credentials. Here’s how:

1. **If you use IAM user credentials:**  
   - Re-run `aws configure` and enter a new Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

2. **If you use temporary credentials (e.g., SSO, MFA, or assumed roles):**  
   - Re-authenticate using your organization's process (e.g., `aws sso login` or your SSO login command).

3. **After updating credentials:**  
   - Try running `npx ampx sandbox` again.

Would you like instructions for a specific authentication method, or should I propose the `aws configure` command for you to refresh your credentials?

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

Your AWS credentials have been refreshed.

You can now try starting the Amplify Gen 2 backend sandbox again:

```sh
npx ampx sandbox
```

Would you like me to run this command for you?

```shellscript
npx ampx sandbox
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

The error now is:

> UnrecognizedClientException: The security token included in the request is invalid.

This means the AWS credentials you entered are not valid for API requests. This could be due to:
- Typo in the Access Key or Secret Access Key
- Using placeholder or expired credentials
- The IAM user not having the required permissions

### What to do next:

1. **Double-check your AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key.**
   - Make sure you are using real, active credentials from the AWS Console (IAM > Users > Security credentials).
   - Do not use placeholder values or expired keys.

2. **Ensure the IAM user has the necessary permissions.**
   - The user should have at least the `AdministratorAccess` policy for POC purposes.

3. **Re-run `aws configure` with the correct credentials.**

Would you like instructions on how to generate new AWS credentials, or do you want to try re-running `aws configure` with new values?

---

**User**

where may I get Access Key and Secret Access Key? do I need to create them in the CLI or they were created before in aws console?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Here’s how Access Key and Secret Access Key work:

### Where to Get Access Key and Secret Access Key

**You get these from the AWS Console, not the CLI.**  
They are associated with an IAM user in your AWS account.

#### Steps to Create or Retrieve Access Keys:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Console** with an account that has permissions to manage IAM users.
2. Go to the **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) service.
3. In the sidebar, click **Users**.
4. Click on your username (or create a new user if needed).
5. Go to the **Security credentials** tab.
6. Scroll down to **Access keys**.
   - If you don’t have an access key, click **Create access key**.
   - If you already have one, you can use it (but you can only see the Secret Access Key at creation time).
7. **Download or copy** the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.  
   - You will not be able to see the Secret Access Key again after you leave the page, so save it securely.

**Note:**  
- If you lose the Secret Access Key, you must create a new one.
- For security, you should not share these keys or commit them to source control.

**User**

is it good idea to create a subfolder "docs" for storing info?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, it is a very good idea to create a subfolder named docs in your project!

### Why use a docs folder?
- Keeps your documentation organized and separate from your code.
- Makes it easy to store setup notes, architecture diagrams, API references, credentials setup instructions (never the actual credentials!), and other project-related information.
- It’s a common convention in open source and professional projects.

### Typical contents for a docs folder:
- `setup.md` (setup instructions)
- `amplify-notes.md` (Amplify-specific notes)
- `architecture.md` (diagrams, architecture decisions)
- `api.md` (API documentation)
- Any other markdown or text files relevant to your project

Would you like me to create a docs folder and a starter markdown file for you?

---

**User**

yes

**Cursor**

```markdown
# Project Setup Notes

Use this file to document important setup steps, credentials instructions (never store actual secrets here), and any other information useful for onboarding or reference.

## AWS Credentials
- How to create and configure IAM user access keys
- Best practices for storing credentials securely

## Amplify Setup

```

A docs folder with a starter setup.md file has been created in your project. You can use this file to document setup steps, AWS credential instructions (never store actual secrets), Amplify setup notes, and anything else useful for your project.

If you’d like to add more documentation templates or have specific topics you want to cover, just let me know!

---

**User**

what else do you think I should have?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Here are some common and helpful additions for a well-organized project, especially for a POC or something you may want to share or revisit later:

---

### 1. More Documentation Files in `docs/`
- **`amplify-notes.md`**: Document Amplify-specific commands, issues, and solutions.
- **`architecture.md`**: Diagrams, architecture decisions, and high-level overviews.
- **`api.md`**: API endpoints, request/response examples, and usage notes.
- **`troubleshooting.md`**: Common errors and their fixes.
- **`features.md`**: List of features you plan to explore or have implemented.

### 2. Project Root Files
- **`README.md`**: High-level project overview, quick start, and links to docs.
- **`.env.example`**: Example environment variables (never actual secrets).
- **`.gitignore`**: Make sure it’s set up to ignore node_modules, .env, AWS credentials, etc.

### 3. Code Quality & Tooling
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript config (already present with CRA).
- **`eslint`/`prettier` config**: For code style and linting.
- **`package.json` scripts**: Useful scripts for build, test, lint, etc.

### 4. Amplify/Backend
- **`amplify/backend.ts`**: Already present, but as you add features, document them in your docs.
- **`amplify/README.md`**: (Optional) Notes about backend resources and structure.

### 5. Testing
- **`tests/` or `__tests__/`**: For unit/integration tests if you plan to write any.
