# AWS Amplify POC - Risk Assessment

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive risk assessment for the AWS Amplify Proof of Concept (POC) project. The overall risk level is **LOW** due to the temporary nature, limited scope, and educational purpose of the project.

## Risk Categories

### 1. Security Risks

#### HIGH IMPACT, LOW PROBABILITY
- **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to todo data
  - **Mitigation**: No sensitive data in POC, AWS security controls
  - **Probability**: Very Low
  - **Impact**: Minimal (test data only)

#### MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW PROBABILITY
- **Credential Compromise**: AWS access keys leaked
  - **Mitigation**: Regular key rotation, MFA, monitoring
  - **Probability**: Low
  - **Impact**: Medium (temporary POC environment)

#### LOW IMPACT, MEDIUM PROBABILITY
- **Unauthorized Resource Creation**: Accidental service provisioning
  - **Mitigation**: Billing alerts, regular monitoring
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Low (cost implications only)

### 2. Financial Risks

#### LOW IMPACT, MEDIUM PROBABILITY
- **Budget Overrun**: Costs exceed $25/month
  - **Mitigation**: Free tier usage, billing alerts, monitoring
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Low ($0-50 maximum exposure)

#### VERY LOW IMPACT, LOW PROBABILITY
- **Runaway Costs**: Infinite loop or resource leak
  - **Mitigation**: Service limits, automatic shutdowns
  - **Probability**: Very Low
  - **Impact**: Very Low (AWS limits prevent major issues)

### 3. Operational Risks

#### LOW IMPACT, HIGH PROBABILITY
- **Learning Curve**: Delays due to unfamiliarity
  - **Mitigation**: Documentation, AWS support, community resources
  - **Probability**: High
  - **Impact**: Low (educational value justifies time)

#### MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW PROBABILITY
- **Service Outages**: AWS service unavailability
  - **Mitigation**: AWS SLA, multiple availability zones
  - **Probability**: Low
  - **Impact**: Medium (temporary development delays)

### 4. Compliance Risks

#### LOW IMPACT, VERY LOW PROBABILITY
- **Data Residency**: Data stored in wrong region
  - **Mitigation**: Explicit region configuration (us-east-1)
  - **Probability**: Very Low
  - **Impact**: Low (no sensitive data)

#### VERY LOW IMPACT, VERY LOW PROBABILITY
- **Audit Issues**: Insufficient logging or monitoring
  - **Mitigation**: CloudTrail enabled, CloudWatch monitoring
  - **Probability**: Very Low
  - **Impact**: Very Low (POC environment)

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Risk Level | Mitigation Priority |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Data Breach | High | Very Low | **LOW** | Medium |
| Credential Compromise | Medium | Low | **LOW** | High |
| Budget Overrun | Low | Medium | **LOW** | Medium |
| Learning Curve | Low | High | **LOW** | Low |
| Service Outages | Medium | Low | **LOW** | Low |
| Runaway Costs | Very Low | Very Low | **VERY LOW** | Low |

## Mitigation Strategies

### Security Mitigations
1. **Access Control**
   - Use temporary IAM user with minimal necessary permissions
   - Enable MFA on IAM user
   - Regular access key rotation (every 30 days)

2. **Monitoring**
   - CloudTrail logging enabled
   - CloudWatch monitoring with alerts
   - Weekly security posture reviews

3. **Data Protection**
   - Use only test data (no production data)
   - Enable encryption at rest and in transit
   - Regular backup verification

### Financial Mitigations
1. **Cost Control**
   - Set up billing alerts at $5, $15, $25
   - Use AWS Free Tier calculator
   - Weekly cost reviews

2. **Resource Management**
   - Tag all resources for tracking
   - Set up automatic resource deletion
   - Use AWS Cost Explorer for monitoring

### Operational Mitigations
1. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive setup documentation
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Knowledge transfer procedures

2. **Support**
   - AWS support plan if needed
   - Community forums and resources
   - Internal mentoring if available

## Incident Response Plan

### Security Incidents
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate AWS credentials
   - Review CloudTrail logs
   - Disable compromised resources

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine scope of access
   - Review affected resources
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore from backups if needed
   - Update security controls
   - Implement additional monitoring

### Financial Incidents
1. **Cost Overrun**
   - Identify high-cost resources
   - Pause non-essential services
   - Optimize resource usage

2. **Billing Disputes**
   - Document resource usage
   - Contact AWS support
   - Review billing statements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Risk Tolerance
- **Maximum Financial Exposure**: $50/month
- **Maximum Security Risk**: Low (test data only)
- **Maximum Operational Impact**: Medium (learning delays acceptable)

### Success Metrics
- **Budget Compliance**: Stay within $25/month
- **Security Posture**: No security incidents
- **Learning Objectives**: Complete POC successfully
