# AWS Amplify - Security Assessment

## Overview
This document provides a security assessment for the AWS Amplify POC project to address common IT security concerns.

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All DynamoDB data encrypted with AWS KMS
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API calls use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- **Data Location**: All data stored in specified AWS region (us-east-1)
- **Data Backup**: Automatic point-in-time recovery available

### Network Security
- **API Gateway**: All API requests go through AWS API Gateway
- **VPC**: Can be configured to run in private VPC if required
- **WAF**: AWS Web Application Firewall can be enabled
- **DDoS Protection**: AWS Shield Standard included by default

### Access Control
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for user management
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained permissions via IAM and Cognito
- **API Security**: API keys and JWT tokens for API access
- **Resource-level Security**: IAM policies control access to AWS resources

### Compliance
- **SOC 2 Type II**: AWS services are SOC 2 compliant
- **ISO 27001**: AWS maintains ISO 27001 certification
- **GDPR**: Data deletion and portability features available
- **HIPAA**: Can be configured for HIPAA compliance if needed

## Security Controls

### 1. Identity and Access Management
```
✅ IAM user with least privilege (after POC)
✅ MFA can be enabled on IAM user
✅ Access key rotation procedures
✅ CloudTrail logging for audit
```

### 2. Data Security
```
✅ Server-side encryption (SSE) enabled
✅ Client-side encryption available
✅ Data masking for sensitive fields
✅ Automatic backups and versioning
```

### 3. Network Security
```
✅ HTTPS/TLS for all communications
✅ API rate limiting and throttling
✅ IP allowlisting capabilities
✅ Private endpoint support
```

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
```
✅ CloudWatch monitoring and alerts
✅ CloudTrail for API call logging
✅ X-Ray for distributed tracing
✅ GuardDuty for threat detection
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Elements
- **Temporary Nature**: POC environment, limited duration
- **Isolated Environment**: No connection to production systems
- **AWS Managed Services**: Security maintained by AWS
- **Free Tier Usage**: Minimal cost exposure

### Medium Risk Elements
- **AdministratorAccess**: Broad permissions for POC convenience
- **API Key Authentication**: Less secure than user-based auth
- **Public API Endpoints**: GraphQL API accessible from internet

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Time-limited Access**: Remove permissions after POC completion
- **Cost Monitoring**: Set up billing alerts
- **Regular Review**: Weekly security posture assessment
- **Clean-up Procedures**: Documented resource deletion process

## Recommended Security Configurations

### For POC Environment
```yaml
Authentication: API Key (simple, fast setup)
Data Access: Public read/write (POC only)
Monitoring: Basic CloudWatch
Backup: Default settings
```

### For Production Environment
```yaml
Authentication: AWS Cognito with MFA
Data Access: User-based permissions
Monitoring: Enhanced with custom metrics
Backup: Automated with retention policies
```

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] IAM user created with appropriate permissions
- [ ] MFA enabled on IAM user (recommended)
- [ ] CloudTrail logging enabled
- [ ] Billing alerts configured

### During Development
- [ ] Regular access key rotation
- [ ] Monitor CloudWatch for anomalies
- [ ] Review CloudTrail logs weekly
- [ ] Test security configurations

### Post-POC Cleanup
- [ ] Delete all AWS resources
- [ ] Remove IAM user and permissions
- [ ] Export any necessary data
- [ ] Conduct security review

## Incident Response Plan

### Potential Issues
1. **Credential Compromise**: Rotate keys immediately
2. **Unusual Activity**: Review CloudTrail logs
3. **Cost Overrun**: Check for resource misuse
4. **Data Access Issue**: Verify IAM permissions

### Contact Information
- **Developer**: [Your Name] - [Your Email]
- **AWS Support**: Available 24/7 through AWS Console
- **Security Team**: [Internal Security Contact]

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Retention
- **Development Data**: Can be deleted after POC
- **Audit Logs**: Retain for 90 days minimum
- **Access Logs**: Available in CloudTrail

### Data Classification
- **POC Data**: Test data only, no production data
- **Personal Data**: Minimal, only for authentication testing
- **Sensitive Data**: None expected in POC environment

## Summary

This POC follows AWS security best practices while maintaining the flexibility needed for rapid development. The temporary nature and limited scope minimize security risks while providing valuable learning opportunities.

**Recommendation**: Approve with the understanding that this is a time-limited, educational POC with proper cleanup procedures.
